## **Project Title**: Employee Management System

### **Technology Stack**:
- **Backend Framework**: Java Spring Boot
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) for token-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based authorization (Employee, Manager, Admin)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA
- **Build Tool**: Maven 
- **REST API**: Fully functional API with secure endpoints

### **Project Overview**:
The **Employee Management System** is a backend application that handles employee data and operations securely. The system is built with Java Spring Boot and uses **Spring Security** to ensure secure access to its resources via **JWT token-based authentication**. The system features **role-based authorization** to allow different levels of access based on user roles (Employee, Manager, Admin).

### **Key Features**:

#### 1. **JWT Token-Based Authentication**:
   - **User Login**: Users can log in using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client, which is required for accessing the protected endpoints.
   - **Token Validation**: Every request to a protected resource requires a valid JWT token. The token is verified for authenticity before granting access.
   - **Password Encryption**: User passwords are securely encrypted using **BCrypt**.

#### 2. **Role-Based Authorization**:
   - The system supports three primary roles: **Employee**, **Manager**, and **Admin**. Each role has specific permissions to perform certain actions.
     - **Employee**: Can view and update personal details, and view team members.
     - **Manager**: Can manage team members, approve leave requests, and update employee statuses.
     - **Admin**: Has full control, including creating and managing users, assigning roles, viewing all data, and generating reports.

#### 3. **Employee Management**:
   - **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations**: The system allows admins to perform CRUD operations on employee data, including adding new employees, updating details, and removing employees from the system.
   - **Profile Management**: Employees can update their own personal information.
   - **Role Assignment**: Admins can assign roles to users (Employee, Manager, Admin).

#### 4. **Secure API Endpoints**:
   - **Protected Endpoints**: All the important routes, such as creating or updating employee details, are protected by **JWT-based authentication**. Only authorized users with valid tokens can access these routes.
   - **Role-Specific Endpoints**: Specific endpoints are accessible only by certain roles:
     - Employees can access only their own information.
     - Managers can access and manage their teamâ€™s information.
     - Admins have access to all endpoints.

#### 5. **Audit Logs**:
   - The system maintains a log of important actions (such as employee creation, updates, and deletion) performed by users with the corresponding role information for audit purposes.

#### 6. **Data Security**:
   - **JWT Expiration**: JWT tokens have a set expiration time to ensure secure access.

#### 7. **Error Handling**:
   - The system has a robust error-handling mechanism to handle various scenarios like invalid credentials, unauthorized access, token expiration, and resource not found.

#### 8. **Database Design**:
   - The system uses a **relational database** to store employee details, roles, and activity logs.
   - **Employee Entity**: Stores employee details such as ID, name, role, department, and contact information.
   - **Manager Entity**: Stores Manger details such as ID, name, department, and Reporting employee List.
   - **Admin Entity**: Stores Admin details such as ID, name, contact information.
   - **User Entity**: Handles user authentication details such as username, password, and JWT token validity.

### **Use Cases**:

#### 1. **Employee**:
   - Log in to the system and access the personal dashboard.
   - Update personal details like phone number, address, etc.

#### 2. **Manager**:
   - Log in and view the list of employees under their management.
   - Approve or reject leave requests, update the status of team members, and manage task assignments.
   - Perform CRUD operations on the employees within their team.

#### 3. **Admin**:
   - Access the admin dashboard and perform full CRUD operations across the system.
   - Assign roles (Employee, Manager, Admin) to other users.
   - Manage all employee records, view activity logs.
   - Monitor and manage the security aspects of the system, such as token expiration and user permissions.

### **Conclusion**:
The **Employee Management System** is a robust, secure backend project that demonstrates a practical implementation of **Spring Boot** with **Spring Security JWT token-based authentication** and **role-based authorization**. It offers clear distinctions between roles (Employee, Manager, Admin) with secure and well-defined access to resources based on the user's role.

The project is highly scalable, enabling further integrations such as **REST API clients**, **frontend applications (React, Angular)**, and **external services** like email notifications, payroll systems, or performance tracking.
